# Nerdle-Solver

## Instructions
A solver for the popular online game nerdle!

Open the file `nerdle_solver.py` in your favorite IDE; the two DAA's at the bottom explain their function in the comments. As for the third one (`nowhere`), simply add the STRING representation of any character that never shows up (shows up black when typed in). This generally allows one to get the answer in 2-3 tries!
